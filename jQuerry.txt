jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and animating for rapid web development. It provides an easy-to-use API for accessing and manipulating the DOM.

Here are some examples of how jQuery can be used to manipulate the DOM:

Document Ready Function
    The $(document).ready() function is used to execute code when the document is fully loaded. This ensures that the code inside the function is executed only when the document is ready to be manipulated.
$(document).ready(function() {
  // Code to execute after the document has loaded
});

Selecting Elements
    jQuery uses CSS-like selectors to select elements in the DOM. The $() function is used to select elements and returns a jQuery object containing the selected elements.
// Selecting elements by ID
$('#my-element')

// Selecting elements by class
$('.my-class')

// Selecting elements by tag name
$('p')

Manipulating Elements
    Once elements are selected, jQuery provides a number of methods for manipulating them. For example, the .text() method can be used to set the text content of an element.
// Setting the text content of an element
$('#my-element').text('Hello, world!')

Adding and Removing Classes
    jQuery also provides methods for adding and removing classes from elements.
// Adding a class to an element
$('#my-element').addClass('my-class')

// Removing a class from an element
$('#my-element').removeClass('my-class')

Binding Events
    jQuery provides a simple way to bind event handlers to elements. The .on() method is used to bind an event to an element, and the callback function is executed when the event is triggered.
// Binding a click event to an element
$('#my-element').on('click', function() {
  // Code to execute when the element is clicked
})

Animations
    jQuery provides an easy way to create animations on elements. The .animate() method can be used to animate CSS properties on an element over a period of time.
// Animating an element
$('#my-element').animate({ opacity: 0.5 }, 1000)

These are just a few examples of the many things that can be done with jQuery. By using jQuery, developers can write less code and achieve the same results as writing plain JavaScript.
