In JavaScript, you can implement functions in two main ways: Imperative and Declarative.
// JS Fns can be implemented in two main ways: 
// imperative
// declarative

Imperative programming 
tell computer how to do something step by step. 
involves giving specific instructions to the computer to execute. 
implemented using loops, conditionals, and other control structures. 
example: function that sums up the elements of an array:

function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

In this function, we use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the array, 
we use a variable sum to keep track of the total sum. 
The function returns the final value of sum.



Declarative programming, 
describing what you want to happen rather than how to do it. 
implemented using higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce. 
example:same function that sums up the elements of an array:

function sumArray(array) {
  return array.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);
}

In this function, we use the reduce method to iterate over the elements of the array and calculate the sum. 
The reduce method takes a callback function that is called for each element in the array. 
The first argument to the callback function (sum) is the accumulated value, 
the second argument (current) is the current value being iterated over. 
The callback function returns the new accumulated value for the next iteration. 
The second argument to the reduce method (0) is the initial value of sum.

declarative implementation  more concise and arguably easier to read and understand. 
allows you to express the logic of your code in a more abstract way, 
which can make it easier to reason about and modify.

Imperative programming:

Declarative programming:

Declarative functions can be implemented using higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce, 

Imperative functions can be implemented using loops, conditionals, and other control structures.
